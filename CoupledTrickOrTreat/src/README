There are two main classes, TwoCoupledHalloweenSimulations and TwoCoupledVetoingHalloweenSimulations.
They couple two simulations in the same process – your task in Comp533 will be 
to couple simulations in (possibly an arbitrary number of)
processes – this means you must run a different program for each process. 
The project uses the referenced project AndersonBeauComp401FinalProject,
a user-interface library I wrote, oeall22.jar, ObjectEditor, which is used by Beau’s code. 

TwoCoupledHaloweenSimulations allows all commands to be executed. TwoCoupledVetoingHalloweenSimulations
shows how one can veto certain changes - undo commands. 
This is useful in 533 if you do extra credit to support locking, which would
disable user input.
