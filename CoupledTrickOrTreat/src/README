There are two main classes, TwoCoupledHalloweenSimulations and TwoCoupledVetoingHalloweenSimulations.
They couple two simulations in the same process – your task in Comp533 will be 
to couple simulations in (possibly an arbitrary number of)
processes – this means you must run a different program for each process. 
The project uses the referenced project AndersonBeauComp401FinalProject,
a user-interface library I wrote, oeall22.jar, ObjectEditor, which is used by Beau’s code. 

TwoCoupledHaloweenSimulations allows all commands to be executed. TwoCoupledVetoingHalloweenSimulations
shows how one can veto certain changes - undo commands. 
This is useful in 533 if you do extra credit to support locking, which would
disable user input.

The project includes also the file RunA1Tests, which is a template for how localchecks are run.
These should all fail as the project does not handle distribution.

Input the following commands in the console and see how they are translated to method calls. The only commands
relevant to A1 are p, s, e.
 
 p
 a true
 a false
 i true
 atomic true
 s "move 30 20"
 e
 l false
 t true
 t false
 q 0
